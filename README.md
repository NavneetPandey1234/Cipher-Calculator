# Cipher-Calculator
Overview
The Cipher Calculator is a Java-based application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using various classical encryption algorithms. This tool is designed for educational purposes, helping users understand the mechanics of different ciphers and how they transform plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.

Features
Caesar Cipher: Simple substitution cipher shifting letters by a fixed number.
Playfair Cipher: Digraph substitution cipher using a 5x5 grid.
Affine Cipher: Uses mathematical functions for encryption.
Vigenere Cipher: Employs a keyword to shift letters based on the keyword's letters.
Rail Fence Cipher: Transposition cipher that arranges text in a zigzag pattern.
Hill Cipher: Uses linear algebra and matrices for encryption.
Row Transposition Cipher: Rearranges the rows of text based on a predefined key.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language used for the application.
Java Swing: For creating a user-friendly graphical interface.
